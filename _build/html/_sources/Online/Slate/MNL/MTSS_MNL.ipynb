    "# MTSS_MNL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **Advantage**: It is both scalable and robust. Furthermore, it also accounts for the iter-item heterogeneity.\n",
    "- **Disadvantage**:\n",
    "- **Application Situation**: Useful when a list of items is presented, each with a matching price or income, and only one is chosen for each interaction. Binary responses from users include click/don't-click and buy/don't-buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Idea\n",
    "MTSS_MNL is an example of the general Thompson Sampling(TS)-based framework, MTSS [1], to deal with dynamic assortment optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review of MTSS:** MTSS[1] is a meta-learning framework designed for large-scale structured bandit problems [2]. Mainly, it is a TS-based algorithm that learns the information-sharing structure while minimizing the cumulative regrets. Adapting the TS framework to a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model, MTSS simultaneously enables information sharing among items via their features and models the inter-item heterogeneity. Specifically, it assumes that the item-specific parameter $\\theta_i$ is sampled from a distribution $g(\\theta_i|\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ instead of being entirely determined by $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ via a deterministic function. Here, $g$ is a model parameterized by an **unknown** vector $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$. The following is the general feature-based hierarchical model MTSS considered. \n",

    "      \\end{alignedat}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $Q(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ is the prior distribution for $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$. \n",
    "Overall, MTTS is a **general** framework that subsumes a wide class of practical problems, **scalable** to large systems, and **robust** to the specification of the generalization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review of MTSS_MNL:** In this tutorial, as a concrete example, we focus on the epoch-type offering schedule and consider modeling the relationship between $\\theta_i$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ with the following Beta-Geometric logistic model:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn1}\n",
    "    \\begin{split}\n",
    "     \\theta_i &\\sim Beta \\big(\\frac{logistic(\\boldsymbol{x}_i^T \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})+ 1}{2}, \\psi \\big) , \\forall i \\in [N],\\\\\n",
    "    Y_{i}^l(a) &\\sim Geometric(\\theta_i), \\forall i \\in a,\\\\\n",
    "    R^l(a) &= \\sum_{i\\in a}Y_{i}^l(a)\\eta_{i},\n",
    "    \\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}where we adopt the mean-precision parameterization of the Beta distribution and $\\psi$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$ are known. We choose this specific form as it is widely observed that $v_i < 1$ [2,3], i.e., no item is more popular than the no-purchase option. This is equal to $\\theta_i \\in (1/2, 1)$. Other generalization models are also possible with minor modifications to the posterior sampling code. \n",
    "The prior $Q(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ can be chosen as many appropriate distributions. For instance, we choose the prior $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}, {\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}})$ with parameters as known. To update the posterior of $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$, we utilize the **Pymc3** package [4]. With a given $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$, the posterior of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ enjoys the Beta-Geometric conjugate relationship and hence can be updated explicitly and efficiently. Finally, for each epoch $l$, $A^{l}$ is selected by linear programming as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    A^{l} = argmax_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\frac{\\sum_{i\\in a}\\eta_{i}v_{i}}{1+\\sum_{j\\in a} v_{j}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "It should be noted that the posterior updating step differs for different pairs of the $Q(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ and the reward distribution, and the corresponding code can be easily modified to different prior/reward distribution specifications if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Details\n",
    "At each epoch $l$, given the feedback $\\mathcal{H}^{l}$ received from previous rounds, there are two major steps, including posterior sampling and combinatorial optimization. Specifically, the posterior sampling step is decomposed into four steps: 1. approximating a posterior distribution of $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$, $P(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}|\\mathcal{H}^{l})$, by **Pymc3**; 2. sampling a $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}$ from $P(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}|\\mathcal{H}^{l})$; 3. updating the posterior distribution of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ conditional on $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}$, $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}},\\mathcal{H}^{l})$, which has an explicit form under the assumption of a Beta-Geometric logistic model; 4. sampling $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ from $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}},\\mathcal{H}^{l})$. Then $\\tilde{v}_{i}$ is calculated as $\\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\theta}_{i}}-1$. Then, the action $A^{l}$ is selected greedily via linear programming. Note that $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}$ can be sampled in a batch mode to further facilitate computationally efficient online deployment.\n",

    "## Key Steps\n",
    "For epoch $l = 1,2,\\cdots$:\n",
    "1. Approximate $P(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}|\\mathcal{H}^{l})$ by **Pymc3**;\n",
    "2. Sample $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}} \\sim P(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}|\\mathcal{H}^{l})$;\n",
    "3. Update $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}},\\mathcal{H}^{l})$\n",
    "4. Sample $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\sim P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}},\\mathcal{H}^{l})$;\n",
    "5. Compute the utility $\\tilde{v}_{i} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\theta}_{i}}-1$;\n",
    "6. Take the action $A^{l}$ w.r.t $\\{\\tilde{v}_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ such that $A^{l} = arg max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} E(R_t(a) \\mid\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{v}})=argmax_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\frac{\\sum_{i\\in a}\\eta_{i}\\tilde{v}_{i}}{1+\\sum_{j\\in a} \\tilde{v}_{j}}$;\n",
    "7. Offer $A^{l}$ until no purchase appears;\n",
    "8. Receive reward $R^{l}$.\n",
