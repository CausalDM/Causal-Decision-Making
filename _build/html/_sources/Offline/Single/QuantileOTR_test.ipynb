The easiest way to conduct policy evaluation and optimization is to estimate the quantiles with respect to some quantile levels in $[0,1]$. There are some cases when it is not satisfactory to only evaluate the mean outcome:\n","\n","\n","\n","1.   **The problem of our interest may not be limited to the mean outcome**: For example, when evaluating the performance of a certain policy in prolonging customers watching time on a video platform, one may be interested in how well the policy is in stimulating the customers at the lower 25% tail, so as to improve the overall prevalence of this platform and attract more potential customers.\n","\n","2.   **Heavy tails**: In the case when the reward distribution is naturally heavy-tailed, the performance of directly estimating the mean outcome (or doing optimization) may be very unstable. In this case, we may want to know the whole picture of the outcome distribution in order to do further statistical inferences.\n","3.   **Skewed distribution**: For example, in the cases when we would like to evaluate the survival time of patients, it may be desirable to consider the treatment regime that maximizes the median of the distribution of the potential outcome.\n","\n","\n","Note: the recent work on discrete Q-learning in Moodie et al. (2014)[2] can be\n","applied to \u001cfirst estimate the probabilities and then invert them to estimate quantiles, but simply taking the inverse to the cummulative density function may cause a lot of potential problems to the qunatile estimation and optimization. \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","### **Main Idea:** \n","In recent years, there are more work focusing on quantile estimating the optimal treatment regime in order to maximize the qunatile at level $\\tau$ given a class of feasible treatment regimes $\\mathbb{D}=\\{I(X^T\\beta>0:\\beta\\in \\mathbb{B})\\}$. That is, the objective function is to maximize\n","   $$\\arg\\max_{d\\in \\mathbb{D}}Q_{\\tau}(Y^*(d)),$$\n","where $Q_{\\tau}$ denotes the quantile value at level $\\tau$. \\\\\n","\n","\n","There are multiple ways to estimate the quantile value at a given level $\\tau$: direct method, inverse probability estimator, and doubly robust estimator. Among all of the three methods, doubly robust estimator (or AIPW estimator) is the one that combines the advantages of both direct method and IPW estimator, which allows some part of the model to be misspecified while pretaining the consistency of the estimation. For an AIPW estimator, the quantile can be estimated by\n","$$\n","\\hat{Q}_{\\tau}(\\beta)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\frac{C_i(\\beta)}{\\hat{\\pi}(X_i,\\beta)}\\rho_{\\tau}(Y_i-a)+\\left(1-\\frac{C_i(\\beta)}{\\hat{\\pi}(X_i,\\beta)}\\right)\\rho_{\\tau}(\\hat{Y}_i^{**}-a)\\right],\n","$$\n","where $\\hat{Y}_i^{**}$ is the pseudo outcome generated from the fitted model when following some policy $d(X_i,\\beta)$.\n","Thus, the optimal policy to maximize a specific quantile of the outcome distribution can be obtained by\n","$$\n","\\arg\\max_{\\beta\\in\\mathbb{B}}\\hat{Q}_{\\tau}(\\beta)\n","$$\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","### **Algorithm:** \n","The main steps of this algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n","\n","\n","1.   Fit the following models by any appropriate method you want: \\\\\n","(a). Propensity score $\\pi(X_i,\\beta)$. Usually the simplest way is to use Logistic regression.\\\\\n","(b). Outcome regression model when treatment $A=1$. We estimate the conditional quantile $Q_{\\tau}(Y^*(1)|X)=g(X,\\beta_1(\\tau))$, for $\\tau$ in a fine grid of $(0,1)$. This yields $\\hat{\\beta}_1(\\tau)$, $\\tau\\in(0,1)$.\\\\\n","(c). Outcome regression model when treatment $A=0$. We estimate the conditional quantile $Q_{\\tau}(Y^*(0)|X)=g(X,\\beta_0(\\tau))$, for $\\tau$ in a fine grid of $(0,1)$. This yields $\\hat{\\beta}_0(\\tau)$, $\\tau\\in(0,1)$.\n","2.  Generate two independent random samples from the uniform distribution on the interval $(0,1)$: $\\{u_{11},\\dots,u_{1n}\\}$ and $\\{u_{01},\\dots,u_{0n}\\}$.\n","3.  Calculate $\\hat{Y}^{**}_i=g(X_i,\\hat{\\beta}_1(u_{1i}))d(X_i,\\beta)+g(X_i,\\hat{\\beta}_0(u_{0i}))(1-d(X_i,\\beta))$, $i=1,\\dots,n$.\n","4.  Using proper methods to find the optimal $\\beta$ for $\\hat{Q}_{\\tau}(\\beta)$. Nelder-mead method was implemented in the following algorithm.\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","### **Demo:** \n","Next, we will use both the simulation data and a real dataset to illustrate the performance of Quantile Optimal Treatment Regime in Wang et al.
