# # MTSS_MNL
# 
# ## Overview
# - **Advantage**: It is both scalable and robust. Furthermore, it also accounts for the iter-item heterogeneity.
# - **Disadvantage**:
# - **Application Situation**: Useful when a list of items is presented, each with a matching price or income, and only one is chosen for each interaction. Binary responses from users include click/don't-click and buy/don't-buy.
# 
# ## Main Idea
# MTSS_MNL is an example of the general Thompson Sampling(TS)-based framework, MTSS [1], to deal with dynamic assortment optimization problems.
# 
# **Review of MTSS:** MTSS[1] is a meta-learning framework designed for large-scale structured bandit problems [2]. Mainly, it is a TS-based algorithm that learns the information-sharing structure while minimizing the cumulative regrets. Adapting the TS framework to a problem-specific Bayesian hierarchical model, MTSS simultaneously enables information sharing among items via their features and models the inter-item heterogeneity. Specifically, it assumes that the item-specific parameter $\theta_i$ is sampled from a distribution $g(\theta_i|\boldsymbol{s}_i, \boldsymbol{\gamma})$ instead of being entirely determined by $\boldsymbol{s}_i$ via a deterministic function. Here, $g$ is a model parameterized by an **unknown** vector $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$. The following is the general feature-based hierarchical model MTSS considered. 
# \begin{equation}\label{eqn:general_hierachical}
#   \begin{alignedat}{2}
# &\text{(Prior)} \quad
# \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad
# \boldsymbol{\gamma} &&\sim Q(\boldsymbol{\gamma}),\\
# &\text{(Generalization function)} \;
# \;    \theta_i| \boldsymbol{s}_i, \boldsymbol{\gamma}  &&\sim g(\theta_i|\boldsymbol{s}_i, \boldsymbol{\gamma}), \forall i \in [N],\\ 
# &\text{(Observations)} \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\;
# \;    \boldsymbol{Y}_t(a) &&\sim f(\boldsymbol{Y}_t(a)|\boldsymbol{\theta}),\\
# &\text{(Reward)} \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\;
# \;   R_t(a) &&= f_r(\boldsymbol{Y}_t(a) ; \boldsymbol{\eta}), 
#       \end{alignedat}
# \end{equation}
# where $Q(\boldsymbol{\gamma})$ is the prior distribution for $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$. 
# Overall, MTTS is a **general** framework that subsumes a wide class of practical problems, **scalable** to large systems, and **robust** to the specification of the generalization model.
# 
# **Review of MTSS_MNL:** In this tutorial, as a concrete example, we focus on the epoch-type offering schedule and consider modeling the relationship between $\theta_i$ and $\boldsymbol{s}_i$ with the following Beta-Geometric logistic model:
# \begin{equation}\label{eqn1}
#     \begin{split}
#      \theta_i &\sim Beta \big(\frac{logistic(\boldsymbol{s}_i^T \boldsymbol{\gamma})+ 1}{2}, \psi \big) , \forall i \in [N],\\
#     Y_{i}^l(a) &\sim Geometric(\theta_i), \forall i \in a,\\
#     R^l(a) &= \sum_{i\in a}Y_{i}^l(a)\eta_{i},
#     \end{split}
# \end{equation}where we adopt the mean-precision parameterization of the Beta distribution and $\psi$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ are known. We choose this specific form as it is widely observed that $v_i < 1$ [2,3], i.e., no item is more popular than the no-purchase option. This is equal to $\theta_i \in (1/2, 1)$. Other generalization models are also possible with minor modifications to the posterior sampling code. 
# The prior $Q(\boldsymbol{\gamma})$ can be chosen as many appropriate distributions. For instance, we choose the prior $\boldsymbol{\gamma} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}, {\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})$ with parameters as known. To update the posterior of $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, we utilize the **Pymc3** package [4]. With a given $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, the posterior of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ enjoys the Beta-Geometric conjugate relationship and hence can be updated explicitly and efficiently. Finally, for each epoch $l$, $A^{l}$ is selected by linear programming as
# \begin{equation}
#     A^{l} = argmax_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \frac{\sum_{i\in a}\eta_{i}v_{i}}{1+\sum_{j\in a} v_{j}}.
# \end{equation}
# It should be noted that the posterior updating step differs for different pairs of the $Q(\boldsymbol{\gamma})$ and the reward distribution, and the corresponding code can be easily modified to different prior/reward distribution specifications if necessary.
# 
# ## Algorithm Details
# At each epoch $l$, given the feedback $\mathcal{H}^{l}$ received from previous rounds, there are two major steps, including posterior sampling and combinatorial optimization. Specifically, the posterior sampling step is decomposed into four steps: 1. approximating a posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, $P(\boldsymbol{\gamma}|\mathcal{H}^{l})$, by **Pymc3**; 2. sampling a $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ from $P(\boldsymbol{\gamma}|\mathcal{H}^{l})$; 3. updating the posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ conditional on $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$, $P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\mathcal{H}^{l})$, which has an explicit form under the assumption of a Beta-Geometric logistic model; 4. sampling $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ from $P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\mathcal{H}^{l})$. Then $\tilde{v}_{i}$ is calculated as $\frac{1}{\tilde{\theta}_{i}}-1$. Then, the action $A^{l}$ is selected greedily via linear programming. Note that $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$ can be sampled in a batch mode to further facilitate computationally efficient online deployment.
# 
# 
# ## Key Steps
# For epoch $l = 1,2,\cdots$:
# 1. Approximate $P(\boldsymbol{\gamma}|\mathcal{H}^{l})$ by **Pymc3**;
# 2. Sample $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \sim P(\boldsymbol{\gamma}|\mathcal{H}^{l})$;
# 3. Update $P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\mathcal{H}^{l})$
# 4. Sample $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sim P(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\tilde{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\mathcal{H}^{l})$;
# 5. Compute the utility $\tilde{v}_{i} = \frac{1}{\tilde{\theta}_{i}}-1$;
# 6. Take the action $A^{l}$ w.r.t $\{\tilde{v}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ such that $A^{l} = arg max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} E(R_t(a) \mid\tilde{\boldsymbol{v}})=argmax_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \frac{\sum_{i\in a}\eta_{i}\tilde{v}_{i}}{1+\sum_{j\in a} \tilde{v}_{j}}$;
# 7. Offer $A^{l}$ until no purchase appears;
# 8. Receive reward $R^{l}$.
