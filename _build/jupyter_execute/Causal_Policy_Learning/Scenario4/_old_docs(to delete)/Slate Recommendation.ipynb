    "# Slate Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on slate recommendation problems, where the agent needs to recommend a slate of items at each round. Here, an item can be a product, a web page, a movie, etc., depending on the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setting\n",
    "Let $T$ be the total number of rounds, and $N$ be the total number of items that are available to recommend. The agent would choose a slate of items at each round $t = 1, \\dots, T$. In other words, an action $a$ is defined as a subset of items, and then the action space $\\mathcal{A}$ consists of all subsets satisfied with some problem-specific constraints. Then we will receive the corresponding stochastic observations $\\boldsymbol{Y}_t$ from the environment, which further determines the reward $R_t$. We assume that the observation $\\boldsymbol{Y}_t$ is generated by a domain model $f$, and the reward $R_t$ is determined through a deterministic function $f_r$. Mathematically, we consider the following popular and general class of bandit problems[1]: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\begin{split}\n",
    "    \\boldsymbol{Y}_t &\\sim f(\\boldsymbol{Y}_t |A_t, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\\\\n",
    "    R_t &= f_r(\\boldsymbol{Y}_t; \\boldsymbol{\\eta}).\n",
    "    \\end{split}\n",
    "    \\label{eqn:main_raw_model}\n",
    "\\end{equation} Here, $f$ is parameterized by some **unknown** parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, which can be factorized over these items as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_N)^T$,  where $\\theta_i$ is the parameter related to the $i$th item. $f_r$ is parameterized by some **known** parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$. Still, the objective is to find a bandit algorithm to maximize the cumulative Reward $\\sum_{t=1}^{T}R_{t}$.\n",

    "- **Online Learning to Rank**: Cascading Bandits [3] is used to characterize how a user interacts with an ordered list of $K$ items;\n",
    "- **Online Combinatorial Optimization**: Combinatorial Semi-Bandits [4] which have numerous applications, including maximum weighted matching, ad allocation, and news page optimization;\n",
    "- ...... \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for any positive integer $N$, we denote the set $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ by $[N]$. Further, we denote the cardinality of set $A$ as $|A|$. $\\mathcal{H}_{t}$ denotes a sequence of observations containing all the tuples of action and corresponding feedback received in previous rounds, excluding round $t$. Specifically, $\\mathcal{H}_{t}=\\{(A_{i},\\boldsymbol{Y}_{i},R_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{t-1}$. If feature information is avialable, we denote $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ as a $d$-dimensional vector of item-specific features.\n",
