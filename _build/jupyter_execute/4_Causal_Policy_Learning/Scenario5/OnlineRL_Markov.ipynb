    "# Ooline Policy Learning and Evaluation in Markovian Environments \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on the online policy learning and evaluation problem in an Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is the most well-known and typically default setup of Reinforcement Learning (RL). \n",
    "From the causal perspective, the data dependency structure is the same with that in [offline RL](section:OPE_OPO_preliminary), with the major difference in that the data collection policy is now data-dependent and the objective is sometimes shifted from finding the optimal policy to maximizing the cumulative rewards. \n",
    "As this is a vast area with a huge literature, we do not aim to repeat the disucssions hear. Instead, we will focus on connecting online RL to the other parts of this paper. \n",
    "We refer interested readers to {cite:t}`sutton2018reinforcement` for more materials.\n",

    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We first recap the infinite-horizon discounted MDP model that we introduced in [offline RL](section:OPE_OPO_preliminary). \n",
    "For any $t\\ge 0$, let $\\bar{a}_t=(a_0,a_1,\\cdots,a_t)^\\top\\in \\mathcal{A}^{t+1}$ denote a treatment history vector up to time $t$. \n",

    "For any $(\\bar{a}_{t-1},\\bar{a}_{t})$, let $S_{t}^*(\\bar{a}_{t-1})$ and $Y_t^*(\\bar{a}_t)$ be the counterfactual state and counterfactual outcome, respectively,  that would occur at time $t$ had the agent followed the treatment history $\\bar{a}_{t}$. \n",
    "The set of potential outcomes up to time $t$ is given by\n",

    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We need two critical assumptions for the MDP model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(MA) Markov assumption**:  there exists a Markov transition kernel $\\mathcal{P}$ such that  for any $t\\ge 0$, $\\bar{a}_{t}\\in \\{0,1\\}^{t+1}$ and $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$, we have \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To either purely evaluate a policy or improve over it, we need to understand its performance (ideally at every state-action tuple), which corresponds to the policy value function estimation and evaluation problem. \n",
    "We introduce two main appraoches in the section. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo (MC).** In an online environment, the most straightforward approach is to just sample trajectories and use the average observed cumulative reward from sub-trajectories that satisfy our conditions as the estimator. \n",
    "Due to the sampling nature, this approach is typically referred to as Monte Carlo {cite:p}`singh1996reinforcement`. \n",
    "For example, to estimate the value $V^{\\pi}(s)$ for a given state $s$, we can sample $N$ trajectories following $\\pi$, then find time points where we visit state $s$, and finally use the returns from then on to construct an average as our value estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning.** \n",
    "One limitation of MC is that one has to wait until the end of a trajectory to collect a data point, which makes it less online and incremental. \n",
    "An alternative is to leverage the Bellman equation and the dynamic optimization structure, as we have utilized in [Paradigm 2](section:FQE). \n",
    "The is known as the Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning {cite:p}`sutton1988learning`. \n",
    "The name is from the fact that it involves the estimate at time point $t$ and $t+1). \n",
    "We first recall the Bellman equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:bellman_Q}\n",
    "    Q^\\pi(a, s) = \\mathbb{E}^\\pi \\Big(R_t + \\gamma Q^\\pi(A_{t + 1}, S_{t+1})  | A_t = a, S_t = s \\Big). \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, suppose we currently have an Q-function estimate $\\hat{Q}^{\\pi}$. \n",
    "Then, after collecting a trasition tuple $(s, a, r, s')$, we can then update the estimate of $\\hat{Q}^{\\pi}(s, a)$ as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{Q}^\\pi(a, s) + \\alpha \\Big[r + \\gamma \\hat{Q}^\\pi(\\pi(s'), s')  - \\hat{Q}^\\pi(a, s) \\Big], \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a learning rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical inference.** As discussed in [Paradigm 4](section:Direct Online Policy Evaluator), statistical inference with adaptively collected data is challenging. \n",
    "To address that issue, {cite:t}`shi2020statistical` leverages a carefully designed data splitting schema to provide valid asymptotic distribution (and hence the confidence interval). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policy Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The online policy optimization problem with MDP is the most well-known RL problem. \n",
    "There are three major approaches: policy-based (policy gradient), value-based (approximate DP), and actor critic. \n",
    "We will focus on illustrate their main idea and connection to other topics in the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy gradient\n",
    "The policy-based algorithms (e.g., REINFORCE {cite:t}`williams1992simple`, TRPO {cite:t}`schulman2015trust`, PPO {cite:t}`schulman2017proximal`) directly learn a policy function $\\pi$ by applying gradient descent to optimize its value. \n",
    "In its simplist form, the value estimation is obtained via MC, i.e., sampling trajectories following a policy. \n",
    "However, the gradient descient is not straightforward, as it requires the value estimation of any policies around the current one to compute the gradient, which is not feasible. \n",
    "Fortunately, we have the following *policy gradient theorem*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bigtriangledown_{\\theta}\\, J(\\theta)\n",
    "&= \n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi(\\cdot;\\theta)}\n",
    "\\big\\{\n",
    "G(\\tau) \\times\n",
    "\\big[\n",
    "\\sum_{t=0}^T \n",
    "\\bigtriangledown_{\\theta}\\, \n",
    "\\log \\pi(A_t| S_t; \\theta)\n",
    "\\big]\n",
    "\\big\\}, \n",
    "\\label{eqn:REINFORCE}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\tau$ represents a trajectory and $\\theta$ parameterizes the policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value-based (Approximate DP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second appraoch is closely related to the Q-function-based appraoch discussed in Paradigm 1 and 2, and in particular, the [FQI](section:FQI) algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the Bellman optimality equations: $Q^*$ is the unique solution of \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    Q(a, s) = \\mathbb{E} \\Big(R_t + \\gamma \\arg \\max_{a'} Q(a, S_{t+1})  | A_t = a, S_t = s \\Big).  \\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\text{(1)}. \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Since the right-hand side of (1) is a contraction mapping on $Q$ and its fixed point is $Q^*$, we can iteratively solve the following problem to update the estimation of $Q^*$: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\t\\widehat{Q}^{{\\ell}}=\\arg \\min_{Q} \n",
    "\t\\sum_{(s,a,r,s') \\sim D}\n",
    "\t\\Big\\{\n",
    "\t\\gamma \\max_{a'} \\widehat{Q}^{\\ell-1}(a', s') \n",
    "    +r- Q(a, s)\n",
    "\\Big\\}^2.  \\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\text{(2)}. \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "One major difference lies in how the optimization above is done. \n",
    "In the offline setting (e.g., [FQI](section:FQI)), $D$ is the fixed batch dataset and the optimization is solved fully. \n",
    "In the original online Q-learning {cite:p}`watkins1992q` algorithm, we only run one gradient descent step in the optimization. \n",
    "There are many variants to improve this idea in different practical ways. \n",
    "Besides, a unique feature of the online setting is the ability to collect new data (i.e., exploration), and how to efficiently explore is another new problem compared with the offline setup. \n",
    "For example, DQN {cite:p}`mnih2015human` maintains a replay buffer and apply epsilon-greedy for exploration, and Double DQN {cite:p}`van2016deep`) uses two different Q-estimators in the RHS of (2) to solve the over estimation issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actor Critic\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the policy gradient approach is the efficiency, since it is heavy to sample new trajectories from scratch to evaluate the current policy and hence has high variance. \n",
    "A natural idea is: \n",
    "if we have a value estimator, then it can be used for policy evaluation as well. \n",
    "Such a motivation is well grounded by the following relationship (there are more extensions): \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bigtriangledown_{\\theta}\\, J(\\theta)\n",
    "&= \n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi(\\cdot;\\theta)}\n",
    "\\big\\{\n",
    "G(\\tau) \\times\n",
    "\\big[\n",
    "\\sum_{t=0}^T \n",
    "\\bigtriangledown_{\\theta}\\, \n",
    "\\log \\pi(A_t| S_t; \\theta)\n",
    "\\big]\n",
    "\\big\\}\\\\\n",
    "&= \n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi(\\cdot;\\theta)}\n",
    "\\big\\{\n",
    "\\sum_{t=0}^T \n",
    "Q_t^{\\theta}(S_t, A_t)\n",
    "\\bigtriangledown_{\\theta}\\,\n",
    "\\log \\pi(A_t| S_t; \\theta)\n",
    "% Q_0^{\\theta}(s,a) \\bigtriangledown_{\\theta}\\, \\pi_\\theta(s)\n",
    "\\big\\}. \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, an actor-critic maintains both a policy function estimator (the actor) to select actions, and an value function estimator (the critic) that evaluates the current policy and guides the direction to apply gradient descent. \n",
    "It hences combines the idea of the first two approaches in this section to improve effiicency. \n",
    "From the other direction, it shares similar ideas with the direct policy search appraoch that we disucssed in Paradigm 1. \n",
    "Popular actor-critic algorithms include A2C {cite:t}`mnih2016asynchronous`, SAC {cite:t}`haarnoja2018soft`, A3C {cite:t}`mnih2016asynchronous`)"
