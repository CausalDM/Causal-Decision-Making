    "# Inverse Probability Weighted Online Policy Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of an ongoing policy plays a vital role in many areas such as medicine and economics, to provide crucial instruction on the early-stop of the online experiment and timely feedback from the environment. Policy evaluation in online learning thus attracts increasing attention by inferring the mean outcome\n",
    "of the optimal policy (i.e., the value) in real-time. We introduce the **inverse probability weighted online policy evaluator** to infer the value under the estimated optimal policy in online learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Application Situations***: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Dependent data generated in the online environment;\n",
    "2. Unknown optimal policy or known fixed policy;\n",
    "3. Contain exploration and exploitation trade-off;\n",
    "4. The overlap between bandit policy and optimal policy is bounded away from 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Advantage of the Evaluator***:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible to implement in practice;\n",
    "2. Without modeling the conditional mean outcome function.\n",

    "## Main Idea\n",

    "### Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on online policy evaluation for contextual linear bandits with deterministic policy for illustration. We first explicitly characterize the **probability of exploration** in the online policy optimization under three commonly used bandit algorithms for exposition, including Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling (TS), and $\\epsilon$-Greedy (EG) methods [[[link to be added]]]. We then propose **inverse probability weighted online policy evaluator** to infer the mean outcome of the optimal online policy. Given a context $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$, we choose an action $a_t$ based on a policy  $\\pi(\\cdot)$ which is defined as a deterministic function that maps the context space to the action space as $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{A}$. We then receive a reward  $r_t$ for all $t \\in  \\mathcal{T} $. Denote the history observations previous to time step $t$ as $\\mathcal{H}_{t-1}=\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_i,a_i,r_i\\}_{1\\leq i\\leq t-1}$. Define the potential reward $R^*(A=a)$ as the reward we would observe given the action as $A=a$. Then the value (Dudík et al., 2011) of a given policy $\\pi(\\cdot)$ is \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    " V(\\pi)\\equiv \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{X}  \\sim P_{\\mathcal{X}}}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\{R^*(A=\\pi(\\boldsymbol{X} ))\\}\\right] =(SUVTA/Ignoribility)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{X}  \\sim P_{\\mathcal{X}}}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\{R|\\boldsymbol{X}, A =\\pi(\\boldsymbol{X} )\\}\\right] =\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{X}  \\sim P_{\\mathcal{X}}}\\left[\\mu\\{ \\boldsymbol{X} ,  \\pi(\\boldsymbol{X} )\\}\\right] .\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "We define the optimal policy as  $\\pi^*(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\equiv argmax_{a\\in \\mathcal{A}} \\mu(\\boldsymbol{x },a),   \\forall \\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}$, that finds the optimal action based on the conditional mean outcome function given a context $\\boldsymbol{x}$. \n",
    "Thus, the optimal value can be defined as  $V^*\\equiv V(\\pi^*)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{X}  \\sim P_{\\mathcal{X}}}\\left[\\mu\\{ \\boldsymbol{X} ,  \\pi^*(\\boldsymbol{X} )\\}\\right]$. In the rest, to simplify the exposition, we focus on two actions, i.e., $\\mathcal{A}=\\{0,1\\}$.  Then the optimal policy is given by\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\pi^*(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\equiv argmax_{a\\in \\mathcal{A}} \\mu(\\boldsymbol{x},a) = \\mathbb{I}\\{\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x},1)>\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x},0)\\}, \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}  \n",
    "Our goal is to infer the value under the optimal policy $\\pi^* $ from the online data generated sequentially by some bandit algorithms. Since the optimal policy is unknown, we estimate the optimal policy from the online data as $\\widehat{\\pi}_t$ by $\\mathcal{H}_{t}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability of Exploration\n",
    "  \n",
    "We next quantify the probability of exploring non-optimal actions at each time step.  Define the status of exploration as $\\mathbb{I}\\{a_t\\not = \\widehat{\\pi}_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )\\}$, indicating whether the action taken by the bandit algorithm is different from the estimated optimal action that exploits the historical information. Here, $\\widehat{\\pi}_t$ can be viewed as the greedy policy at time step $t$. Thus the probability of exploration is defined by \n",
    " \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\kappa_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t)\\equiv  Pr\\{a_t\\not = \\widehat{\\pi}_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )\\} =  \\mathbb{E} [ \\mathbb{I}\\{a_t\\not = \\widehat{\\pi}_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )\\}],\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where the expectation in the last term is taken respect to $a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and history $\\mathcal{H}_{t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse Probability Weighted Online Policy Evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the probability of exploration, we define the probability of exploitation as\n",
    " \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Pr\\{a_t = \\widehat{\\pi}_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )\\} = 1-{\\kappa}_t (\\boldsymbol{x}_t ) =  \\mathbb{E}[ \\mathbb{I}\\{a_t = \\widehat{\\pi}_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )\\}].\n",
    "\\end{equation*}   \n",
    "Following the inverse probability weighted value estimator in Dudík et al., (2011), we propose the inverse probability weighted mean outcome estimator as the value estimator under the optimal policy as\n",
    " \\begin{equation}\\label{dr_est}\n",
    "\\widehat{V}_T={1\\over T }\\sum_{t=1}^T {\\mathbb{I}\\{a_t=\\widehat{\\pi}_t(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )\\} \\over 1-\\widehat{\\kappa}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )}  r_t,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $T$ is the current/termination time, and $1-\\widehat{\\kappa}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{x}_t )$ is the estimated matching probability between the chosen action $a_t$ and estimated optimal action given $\\boldsymbol{x}_t $, which captures the probability of exploitation.  \n",
