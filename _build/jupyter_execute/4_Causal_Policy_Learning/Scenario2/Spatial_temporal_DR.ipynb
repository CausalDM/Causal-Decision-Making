    "The third category, the \\textit{doubly robust} (DR) approach, combines DM and IS to achieve low variance and bias \\citep{jiang2016doubly, farajtabar2018more, uehara2019minimax}. \n",
    "The DR technique has also been widely studied in statistics \\citep{rotnitzky1995semiparametric}. \n",
    "It typically requires both a direct method-type estimator and an IS-type estimator, and then integrates them in a carefully designed form. \n",
    "\n",
    "In OPE, a DR estimator first requires a Q-function estimator, denoted as $\\widehat{Q}$, which can be learned by various methods in the literature, such as FQE introduced in Section \\ref{sec:DM}. \n",
    "Denote the corresponding plug-in V-function estimator as $\\widehat{V}$. \n",
    "These estimators will then be integrated with importance ratios in a form typically motivated by the Bellman equation \\eqref{eqn:bellman_Q}. \n",

    "The final value estimator is then defined as $\\widehat{V}_{DR}^0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The name, doubly robust, reflects the fact that the DR estimators are typically consistent as long as one of the two components is consistent, and hence the estimator is doubly robust to model mis-specifications. \n",
    "Besides, a DR estimator typically has lower (or comparable) bias and variance than its components, in the asymptotic sense.  \n",
    "However, similar with the standard IS methods, standard DR estimators also rely on per-step importance ratios  and hence will suffer from huge variance when the horizon is long. \n",

(SA) is automatically  satisfied when the initial distribution equals the stationary distribution. Besides, When the MDP is a Harris ergodic chain , the process will eventually mix well and we can replace the stationary distribution with its limiting assumption and the following discussions will continue to hold.
