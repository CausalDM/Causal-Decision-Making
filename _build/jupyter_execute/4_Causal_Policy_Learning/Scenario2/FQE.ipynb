    "\n",
    "The most straightforward approach for OPE is the direct method (DM). \n",
    "As suggested by the name, \n",
    "methods belonging to this category will first directly impose a model for either the environment or the Q-function, and then learn the model by regarding the task as a regression (or classification) problem, and finally calculate the value of the target policy via a plug-in estimator according to the definition of $\\eta^\\pi$\n",
    "The Q-function based approach and the environment-based approach are also called as model-free and  model-based, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the many model-free DM estimators, we will focus on the most classic one, the fitted-Q evaluation (FQE) {cite:p}`le2019batch`. \n",
    "It is observed to perform consistently well in a large-scale empirical study {cite:p}`voloshin2019empirical`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Advantages***:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conceptually simple and easy to implement\n",
    "2. Good numerical results when the the model class is chosen appropriately \n",

    "**FQE.**\n",
    "FQE is mainly motivated by the fact that, the true value function $Q^\\pi$ is the unique solution to the Bellman equation (1). \n",
    "Besides, the right-hand side of (1) is a contraction mapping. \n",
