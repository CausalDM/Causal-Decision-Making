    "# MovieLens\n",
    "Movie Lens is a website that helps users find the movies they like and where they will rate the recommended movies. [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) is a dataset including the observations collected in an online movie recommendation experiment and is widely used to generate data for online bandit simulation studies. The goal of the simulation studies below is to learn the reward distribution of different movie genres and hence to recommend the optimal movie genres to the users to optimize the cumulative user satisfaction. In other words, every time a user visits the website, the agent will recommend a movie genre ($A_t$) to the user, and then the user will give a rating ($R_t$) to the genre recommended. We assume that users' satisfaction is fully reflected through the ratings. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the bandit algorithms is to optimize the cumulative ratings received by finding and recommending the optimal movie genre that will receive the highest rating. In this tutorial, we mainly focus on the following 4 Genres, including \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comedy**: $a=0$,\n",
    "- **Drama**: $a=1$\n",
    "- **Action**: $a=2$,\n",
    "- **Thriller**: $a=3$,\n",
    "- **Sci-Fi**: $a=4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $K=5$. For each user, feature information, including age, gender and occupation, are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age**: numerical, from 18 to 56,\n",
    "- **gender**: binary, =1 if male,\n",
    "- **college/grad student**: binary, =1 if a college/grad student,\n",
    "- **executive/managerial**: binary, =1 if a executive/managerial,\n",
    "- **technician/engineer**: binary, =1 if a technician/engineer,\n",
    "- **other**: binary, =1 if having other occupations other than the rest of the four occupations,\n",
    "- **academic/educator**: if an academic/educator, then all the previous occupation-related variables = 0 (baseline).\n",
    "\n",
    "The realized reward $R_t$ is a numerical variable, taking the value of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$,with 1 being the least satisfied and 5 being the most satisfied. In the following, we first perform causal effect learning on the logged data and output the estimated reward for each movie genre. Then, we conduct online learning to efficiently explore the optimal policy utilizing both the estimation results and new information collected through real-time online iteraction."

    "On the one hand, while the greedy algorithm outperforms the TS algorithms in the early stages due to extra exploration, both TS algorithms continue to learn new information from the environment and eventually outperform the greedy algorithm. On the other hand, when the results of the uninformative TS are compared to the results of the informative TS, it is clear that the TS algorithm with an informative prior outperforms the uninformative TS, especially in the early stages, due to the use of prior information obtained from the CEL step. Based on the result of the last replicate of the informative TS, the mean of the final estimation of the posterior distribution of $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$ is summarized as follows (it can be retrieved by `informative_TS.u`):\n",
