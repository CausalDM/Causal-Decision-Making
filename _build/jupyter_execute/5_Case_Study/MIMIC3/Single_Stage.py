# ## MIMIC III (Single-Stage)
# 
# In this notebook, we conducted analysis on the MIMIC III data with a single stage. We first analyzed the mediation effect and then evaluate the policy of interest and calculated the optimal policy. As informed by the causal structure learning, here we consider Glucose and PaO2_FiO2 as confounders/states, IV_Input as the action, SOFA as the mediator.

# # CEL: Single-Stage Mediation Analysis

# Under the single-stage setting, we are interested in analyzing the treatment effect on the final outcome Died_within_48H observed at the end of the study by comparing the target treatment regime that provides IV input for all patients and the control treatment regime that does not provide any treatment. Using the direct estimator proposed in [1], IPW estimator proposed in [2], and robust estimator proposed in [3], we examine the natural direct and indirect effects of the target treatment regime based on observational data. With the code in the following blocks, the estimated effect components are summarized in the following:
# 
# |                  |   DE   | IE     | TE     |
# |------------------|:------:|--------|--------|
# | Direct Estimator | -.3465 |  .0097 | -.3368 |
# | IPW              | -.4585 | 0      | -.4584 |
# | Robust           | -.3643 | -.0482 | -.4126 |
# 
# Specifically, when compared to no treatment, always giving IV input has a negative impact on the survival rate, among which the effect directly from actions to the final outcome dominates.

# As an example, we use the **Q-learning** algorithm to evaluate policies based on the observed data, with the linear regression models defined as the following:
# \begin{align}
# Q(s,a,\boldsymbol{\beta}) = &\beta_{00}+\beta_{01}*\textrm{Glucose}+\beta_{02}*\textrm{PaO2_FiO2}\\
#                     &I(a_1=1)*\{\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}*\textrm{Glucose}+\beta_{12}*\textrm{PaO2_FiO2}\},
# \end{align}
# 
# Using the code below, we evaluated two target polices (regimes). The first one is a fixed treatement regime that applies no treatment (Policy1), with an estimated value of .9050. Another is a fixed treatment regime that applies treatment all the time (Policy2), with an estimated value of .5085. Therefore, the treatment effect of Policy2 comparing to Policy1 is -.3965, implying that receiving IV input increase the mortality rate.

# ## CPL: Single-Stage Policy Optimization

# Further, to find an optimal policy maximizing the expected value, we use the **Q-learning** algorithm again to do policy optimization. Using the regression model we specified above and the code in the following block, the estimated optimal policy is summarized as the following regime.
# 
# 1. We would recommend $A=0$ (IV_Input = 0) if $.0014*\textrm{Glucose}+.0015*\textrm{PaO2_FiO2}<1.106$
# 2. Else, we would recommend $A=1$ (IV_Input = 1).
#     
# Appling the estimated optimal regime to individuals in the observed data, we summarize the regime pattern for each patients in the following table:
# 
# | # patients | IV_Input | 
# |------------|----------|
# | 56         | 0        |
# | 1          | 1        |
