# ## Mimic3 Demo
# 
# [Mimic3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asjad99/mimiciii) is a large open-access anonymized single-center database which consists of comprehensive clinical data of 61,532 critical care admissions from 2001â€“2012 collected at a Boston teaching hospital. Dataset consists of 47 features (including demographics, vitals, and lab test results) on a cohort of sepsis patients who meet the sepsis-3 definition criteria.
# 
# Due to the privacy concerns, we utilized a subset of he original Mimic3 data that is publicly available on Kaggle. For illustration purpose, we selected several representative features for the following analysis:
# 
# *   **Glucose**: glucose values of patients
# *   **paO2**: The partial pressure of oxygen
# *   **PaO2_FiO2**: The partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of oxygen delivered (FIO2) ratio.
# *   **SOFA**: Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score to describe organ dysfunction/failure.
# *   **iv-input**: the volumn of fluids that have been administered to the patient.
# *   **died_within_48h_of_out_time**:  the mortality status of the patient after 48 hours of being administered.
# 
# In the next sections, we will start from causal discovery learning to learn significant causal diagram from the data, and then quantify the effect of treatment ('iv_input') on the outcome (mortality status, denoted by 'died_within_48h_of_out_time' variable in the data) through causal effect learning.

# According to the amount of fluid administraition throughout the entire treatment period, we plot the average IV input for each patient as below:

# In[14]:


plt.hist(mimic3_data['IV Input'])


# As we can see from the histogram above, there is a small gap when the average IV Input is around $1.5$. This gap naturally split the data into two treatment groups: "High-IV-Input" group and "Low-IV-Input" group. We are interested in whether the highe level fluid intake treatment is able to decrease the SOFA score and the death rate of patients within 48 hours of administration.
# 
# Motivated by this problem, we set the "High-IV-Input" group as the treatment group with $A=1$, and set the "Low-IV-Input" group as the control group with $A=0$.

# As we can see from the estimated treatment effect of each patient, a higher volumn of fluid intake is inclined to cause negative impact on patients' health status. This may seem counterintuitive to us, which may indicates some selection bias within this small dataset. Despite so, this result also remind us to pay attention to the potentially unnecessary fluid intake that may increase the death rate of patients.

# In[20]:


np.where(mu1.predict(data_CEL_selected.iloc[:,userinfo_index])-mu0.predict(data_CEL_selected.iloc[:,userinfo_index])==-2)[0]


# Patient # {0, 32, 48, 52, 55} might be the sufferer of the over intake of fluid.

# In[21]:


sum(HTE_T_learner)/len(data_CEL_selected)


# Overall, IV Input is expected to increase the death-within-48-hours rate of all patients by 20.40%.

# ### Regard 'SOFA' as the outcome variable

# In[22]:

# outcome: SOFA score (treated as continuous). The smaller, the better
# treatment: iv_input (binary)

# Similarly, we estimate the causal effect of fluid administration on the average SOFA score of patients to see if higher IV input is able to decrease the SOFA score.

# Although for some patients, higher volumn of fluid intake is able to decrease their overall SOFA score, most of the rest of the patients suffered some bad effects from it.

sum(HTE_T_learner)/len(data_CEL_selected)


# **Conclusion**: IV Input is expected to increase the SOFA score by 0.086.
