# ## Mimic3
# 
# [Mimic3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asjad99/mimiciii) is a large open-access anonymized single-center database which consists of comprehensive clinical data of 61,532 critical care admissions from 2001â€“2012 collected at a Boston teaching hospital. Dataset consists of 47 features (including demographics, vitals, and lab test results) on a cohort of sepsis patients who meet the sepsis-3 definition criteria.
# 
# Due to the privacy concerns, we utilized a subset of he original Mimic3 data that is publicly available on Kaggle. For illustration purpose, we selected several representative features for the following analysis:
# 
# *   **Glucose**: glucose values of patients
# *   **paO2**: The partial pressure of oxygen
# *   **PaO2_FiO2**: The partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of oxygen delivered (FIO2) ratio.
# *   **SOFA**: Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score to describe organ dysfunction/failure.
# *   **iv-input**: the volumn of fluids that have been administered to the patient.
# *   **died_within_48h_of_out_time**:  the mortality status of the patient after 48 hours of being administered.
