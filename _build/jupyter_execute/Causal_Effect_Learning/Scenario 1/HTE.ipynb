    "# Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation (Single Stage)\n",
    "In the previous section, we've introduced the estimation of average treatment effect, where we aims to estimate the difference of potential outcomes by executing action $A=1$ v.s. $A=0$. That is, \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{ATE}=\\mathbb{E}[R(1)-R(0)].\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will focus on the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE), which is also one of the main focuses in causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Idea\n",
    "Let's first consider the single stage setup, where the observed data can be written as a state-action-reward triplet $\\{S_i,A_i,R_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ with a total of $n$ trajectories. Heterogeneous treatment effect, as we can imagine from its terminology, aims to measure the heterogeneity of the treatment effect for different subjects. Specifically, we define HTE as $\\tau(s)$, where\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\tau(s)=\\mathbb{E}[R(1)-R(0)|S=s],\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S=s$ denotes the state information of a subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation of HTE is widely used in a lot of real cases such as precision medicine, advertising, recommendation systems, etc. For example, in adversiting system, the company would like to know the impact (such as annual income) of exposing an ad to a group of customers. In this case, $S$ contains all of the information of a specific customer, $A$ denotes the status of ads exposure ($A=1$ means exposed and $A=0$ means not), and $R$ denotes the reward one can observe when assigned to policy $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the ad is a picture of a dress that can lead the customers to a detail page on a shopping website. In this case, females are more likely to be interested to click the picture and look at the detail page of a dress, resulting in a higher conversion rate than males. The difference of customers preference in clothes can be regarded as the heterogeneity of the treatment effect. By looking at the HTE for each customer, we can clearly estimate the reward of ads exposure from a granular level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another related concept is conditional averge treatment effect, which is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{CATE}=\\mathbb{E}[R(1)-R(0)|Z],\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z$ is a collection of states with some specific characsteristics. For example, if the company is interested in the treatment effect of exposing the dress to female customers, $Z$ can be defined as ``female\", and the problem can be addressed under the structure CATE estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different approaches in single-stage HTE estimation\n",
    "Next, let's briefly summarize some state-of-the-art approaches in estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect. \n"
