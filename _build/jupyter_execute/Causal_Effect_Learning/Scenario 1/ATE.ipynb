    "# ATE Estimation \n",
    "Average treatment effect (ATE), is a measure used to compare treatments (or interventions) in randomized experiments, evaluation of policy interventions, and medical trials. As we've introduced in the preliminary section, it aims to estimate the difference of some reward function in between treatment and control. Under the potential outcome's framework, or the notation of do-operator in RL-based literature, our main purpose lies in estimating and inferring on \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "Under three common assumptions in causal inference, we can identify, or consistently estimate the potential outcome $\\{R^*(0),R^*(1)\\}$ from the observed data. These assumptions are 1) Consistency, 2) No unmeasured confounders (NUC), and 3) Positivity assumption.\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "That is, the actual response that is observed for the $i$-th individual in our sample, $R_i$, who received treatment $A_i$, is the same as the potential outcome for that assigned treatment regardless of the experimental conditions used to assign treatment. This assumption also indicates that there is no interference between subjects in the population, that is, the observed response for any individual is not affected by the responses of other individuals.\n",

    "\\{R^*(0), R^*(1)\\} \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|S\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We cannot use the data in an observational study to either confirm or refute this assumption. However, if we believe that $X$ contained all the relevant information about the treatment assignment, then it will be reasonable to make the above assumption. \n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "0 < P(A=1|S=s) < 1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "This assumption ensures that for any given individual in treatment group $1$, we are able to find a similar individual in treatment group $0$, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "We remark that these three assumptions are commonly imposed in causal inference and individualized treatment regimes literature [1]. Moreover, NUC and Positivity assumptions are automatically satisfied in randomized studies where the behavior policy is usually a strictly positive function independent of $s$. \n",

    "Based on the three assumptions above, we can re-write ATE as a function of the observed data. The details are shown below:\n",

    "### 2. Importance Sampling Estimator\n",
    "The second type of estimators is called importance sampling (IS) estimator, or inverse propensity score (IPW) and augmented inverse propensity score (AIPW) in causal inference literature.\n",

    "Before we proceed, let's define the propensity score as below:\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",

    "\n",
    "The motivation of IPW is as follows. Since the propensity (probability) of receiving treatment $1$ is $\\pi(S)$ for an individual with baseline covariates $S$, then every individual with covariates $X_i$ that was observed to receive treatment 1 in our sample is weighted by $1/\\pi(S_i)$ so that their response not only represent themselves but also other individuals who did not receive treatment 1. More formally, we will show that $\\frac{AR}{\\pi(S)}$ is an unbiased estimator of $E[R^*(1)]$. This follows that, given the `positivity` assumption,\n",
