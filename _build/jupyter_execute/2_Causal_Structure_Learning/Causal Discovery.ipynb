    "# Causal Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Most existing methodologies for average / heterogeneous treatment effects and personalized decision making rely on a known causal structure. This enables us to locate the right variables to control (e.g., confounders), to intervene (e.g., treatments), and to optimize (e.g., rewards). However, such a convenience is violated in many emerging real applications with unknown causal reasoning. Causal discovery thus attracts more and more attention recently to infer causal structure from data and disentangle the complex relationship among variables. In the following, we review the basic terminologies in causal discovery, discuss how these related to average / heterogeneous treatment effects and personalized decision making, and detail three classical ways of causal discovery.\n"

    "### General Causal Graph Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a graph $\\mathcal{G} =(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{E})$ with a node set $\\mathbf{Z}$ and an edge set $\\mathbf{E}$. A node $Z_i$ is said to be a parent of $Z_j$ if there is a directed edge from $Z_i$ to $Z_j$. Let the set of all parents of node $Z_j$ in $\\mathcal{G}$ as $PA_{Z_j} (\\mathcal{G})$. A directed graph that does not contain directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Suppose a DAG $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{E})$ that characterizes the causal relationship among $|\\mathbf{Z}|=d$ nodes, where $\\mathbf{Z}=[Z_1,Z_2,\\cdots,Z_d]^\\top $ represents a random vector and an edge $Z_i\\rightarrow Z_j$ means that $Z_i$ is a direct cause of $Z_j$.

    "### Overview of Popular Causal Discovery Learners \n",
    "\n",
    "Causal discovery learners propose to learn a plusible causal graph from the observational data (up to Markovian Equivalent Class unless certain assumptions are satisfied for identifiability). Wide literature on causal discovery can be summarized in three classes (for models specified above). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first type focuses on local **conditional independence tests** to find a causal skeleton and then determine the orientation of edges, such as the well-known PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000; Kalisch & Bühlmann, 2007). However, testing the conditional independence of continuous variables is not easy (Shah & Peters, 2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The second class specifies properly **functional causal models with additional assumptions on data distribution**, including the ICA-LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006) and the causal additive model (CAM) (Bühlmann et al., 2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The last class, **the score-based method**, includes the greedy equivalence search (GES) (Chickering, 2002) and the fast GES (fGES) (Ramsey et al., 2017) that use for example Bayesian scores in searching a space of causal models. Recently, Zheng et al. (2018) opened up another track of score-based methods by constructing an optimization with an acyclicity constraint under the linear structural equation model (LSEM), i.e. the NOTEARS. A follow-up work using a VAE parameterized by a graph neural network that generalizes LSEM was proposed in Yu et al. (2019) with a more computational friendly constraint, namely DAG-GNN. Also see Zhu & Chen (2019) and Cai et al. (2021) for other cutting-edge structural learning methods. \n",
