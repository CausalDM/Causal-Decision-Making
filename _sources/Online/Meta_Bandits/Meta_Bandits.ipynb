    "# Meta Bandits\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, a new class of bandit learning algorithms, named meta Bandits, has been developed to utilize learned information to accelerate learning new tasks and share information efficiently across tasks from a perspective of meta-learning, which is also known as *learning how to learn* [1,2,3,4]. Most related literature on meta Bandits is TS-based, and all focus on sharing knowledge across a large number of relatively simple bandit tasks, such as MAB. For example, consider one of our motivating examples--**Healthcare**. Patients need to learn their own optimal treatment among a few (i,e., $K$) treatments. Here each patient is a task, and the learning process of each patient is simply a $K$-Armed Bandit. Denote $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_j$ a $K$-dimensional vector, where $\\mu_{j,a}$ is the expected reward of action $a$ for task $j$. We aim to utilize the information observed from the \n",
    "interactions with other patients $i$ to help learn the distribution of expected reward for different treatments of the patient $j$ who requires a treatment recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $N$ be the number of tasks, $T$ be the number of rounds for each task, and $K$ be the number of arms (actions to be selected). The agent would interact with each task repeatedly in any arbitraty order. Specifically, for each task $j$, at its $t^{th}$ decsion point, the agent would choose one arm $A_{j,t}$ from the action space $\\mathcal{A} = \\{0,1,\\cdots, K-1\\}$. Then the agent will receive the corresponding stochastic reward $R_{j,t}$ generated from the environment. Denote the reward that would be received if arm $a$ is played as $R_{j,t}(a)$, which we will refer to as the potential reward of arm $a$ for task $i$ at decision point $t$. Similar to the MAB problems, most real-world applications always lack information about the reward distribution of the random variable $R_{j,t}(a)$. Thus, the agent needs to learn reward distributions for different tasks and arms based on feedback received, with an ultimate goal of maximizing the cumulative reward $\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}R_{j,t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for any positive integer $N$, we denote the set $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ by $[N]$. Let $\\mathcal{H}=\\{(A_{k}, R_{k}, j(k))\\}_{k=1}^n$  be a sequence of observations including all the action-and-feedback tuples from the previous $n$ rounds, where the data for all tasks have been combined and re-indexed. Here, the action taken is denoted by $A_k$, the reward received is denoted by $R_k$, and the task index for the $k^{th}$ tuple in $\\mathcal{H}$ is denoted by $j(k)$. If there is feature information available and being used, we denote $\\boldsymbol{s}_j$ as a $d$-dimensional vector of item-specific features, and then $\\mathcal{H}=\\{(A_{k}, R_{k}, \\boldsymbol{s}_{k}, j(k))\\}_{k=1}^n$."

    "**1. MovieLens**\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie Lens is a website that helps users find the movies they like and where they will rate the recommended movies. [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) is a dataset including the observations collected in an online movie recommendation experiment and is widely used to generate data for online bandit simulation studies. The goal of the simulation studies below is to learn the reward distribution of different movie genres and hence to recommend the optimal movie genres to the users to optimize the cumulative user satisfaction. In other words, every time a user visits the website, the agent will recommend a movie genre ($A_t$) to the user, and then the user will give a rating ($R_t$) to the genre recommended. We assume that users' satisfaction is fully reflected through the ratings. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the bandit algorithms is to optimize the cumulative ratings received by finding and recommending the optimal movie genre that will receive the highest rating. In this chapter, we mainly focus on the top 5 Genres, including \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comedy**: $a=0$,\n",
    "- **Drama**: $a=1$,\n",
    "- **Action**: $a=2$,\n",
    "- **Thriller**: $a=3$,\n",
    "- **Sci-Fi**: $a=4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $K=5$. For each user, feature information, including age, gender and occupation, are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age**: numerical, from 18 to 56,\n",
    "- **gender**: binary, =1 if male,\n",
    "- **college/grad student**: binary, =1 if a college/grad student,\n",
    "- **executive/managerial**: binary, =1 if a executive/managerial,\n",
    "- **academic/educator**: binary, =1 if an academic/educator,\n",
    "- **technician/engineer**: binary, =1 if a technician/engineer,\n",
    "- **writer**: if a writer, then all the previous occupation-related variables = 0 (baseline).\n",
    "\n",
    "We preprocessed the dataset to leave users with at least 500 data points, which gives us N=175 users. Furthermore, there are two different types of the reward $R_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Bandit**: $R_t$ is a numerical variable, taking the value of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, where 1 is the least satisfied and 5 is the most satisfied.\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Bandit**: $R_t$ is a binary variable, =1 if the rating is higher than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we evaluated the empirical performance of the supported algorithms on the MovieLens dataset under either the Gaussian bandit or Bernoulli bandit settings."
