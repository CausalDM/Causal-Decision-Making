    "In this section, we introduce the formulation of the Markov Decision Process and a few related concepts which will be used repeatedly in this chapter. \n",
    "We will proceed under the potential outcome framework, which provides a unique causal perspectiy, is different from the conventional notations {cite:p}`sutton2018reinforcement`, and is largely based on {cite:t}`shi2020reinforcement`. \n",
    "Some of the assumptions to be discussed (such as the sequential randomization assumption) are imposed implicitly in the RL literature. \n",
    "By writting these assumptions out, we aim to provide a more formal theoretical ground as well as to connect RL to the causal inference literautre. "
