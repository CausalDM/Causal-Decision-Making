    "# Preliminaries of Causal Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most existing methodologies for average / heterogeneous treatment effects and personalized decision making rely on a known causal structure. This enables us to locate the right variables to control (e.g., confounders), to intervene (e.g., treatments), and to optimize (e.g., rewards). However, such a convenience is violated in many emerging real applications with unknown causal reasoning. Causal discovery thus attracts more and more attention recently to infer causal structure from data and disentangle the complex relationship among variables. \n"

    "### General Causal Graph Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a graph $\\mathcal{G} =(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{E})$ with a node set $\\mathbf{Z}$ and an edge set $\\mathbf{E}$. A node $Z_i$ is said to be a parent of $Z_j$ if there is a directed edge from $Z_i$ to $Z_j$. Let the set of all parents of node $Z_j$ in $\\mathcal{G}$ as $PA_{Z_j} (\\mathcal{G})$. A directed graph that does not contain directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Suppose a DAG $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{E})$ that characterizes the causal relationship among $|\\mathbf{Z}|=d$ nodes, where $\\mathbf{Z}=[Z_1,Z_2,\\cdots,Z_d]^\\top $ represents a random vector and an edge $Z_i\\rightarrow Z_j$ means that $Z_i$ is a direct cause of $Z_j$.

    "### Toy Example 2:  Causal Graph for Causal Mediation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a method to dissect total effect of a treatment into direct and indirect effect. The direct effect is how the treatment directly affects the outcome, and the indirect effect is transmitted via mediator $M$ to the outcome.\n",

    "Pearl et al. (2009) provided a comprehensive review of recent advances in causal mediation analysis using ‘do-operator’ by graphical methods. Let $\\mathbf{M}=[M_1,M_2,\\cdots,M_p]^\\top $ be mediators with dimension $p$. Suppose there exists a weighted DAG $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathbf{Z},\\mathbf{E})$ that characterizes the causal relationship among $\\mathbf{Z}=[A, \\mathbf{M}^\\top, R]^\\top $.  The total effect ($TE$), the natural direct effect that is not mediated by mediators ($DE$), and the natural indirect effect that is regulated by mediators ($IE$) are defined as:\n",

    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "TE &={\\partial E\\{R|do(A=a)\\} / \\partial a}= E\\{R|do(A=a+1)\\}-E\\{R|do(A=a)\\},\\\\\n",
    "DE &= E\\{R|do(A=a+1, \\mathbf{M}=\\mathbf{m}^{(a)})\\}-E\\{R|do(A=a)\\},\\\\\n",

    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $do(A=a)$ is a mathematical operator to simulate physical interventions that hold $A$ constant as $a$ while keeping the rest of the model unchanged, which corresponds to remove edges into $A$ and replace $A$ by the constant $a$ in $\\mathcal{G}$. Here, $\\mathbf{m}^{(a)}$ is the value of $\\mathbf{M}$ if setting $do(A=a)$, and $\\mathbf{m}^{(a+1)}$ is the value of $\\mathbf{M}$ if setting $do(A=a+1)$. Refer to Pearl et al. (2009) for more details of `do-operator'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connection to Average Treatment Effect: When there is no mediator, i.e., only $A$ and $Y$ in the system, there is no indirect effect. Then the defined total effect ($TE$) reduced to the average treatment effect (ATE): $\\text{ATE} = E[R^*(1) - R^*(0)] = E[ R|do(A=1)] -  E[ R|do(A=0)] = TE = DE$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Connection to Conditional Average Treatment Effect: When there is no mediator but with additional modifiers $S$ in the system, we have the conditional average treatment effect (CATE), i.e., $\\text{CATE} = E[R^*(1) - R^*(0)|S] = E[ R|do(A=1),S] -  E[ R|do(A=0),S] = DE(S) = TE(S)$."
