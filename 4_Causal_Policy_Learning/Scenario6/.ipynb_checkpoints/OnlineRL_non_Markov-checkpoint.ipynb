    "When the horizon is short (e.g., 2 or 3), it is still feasible to learn a time-dependent policy that directly utilizes the vector of all historical information for decision making. This is the online version of the DTR problem and was recently studied in {cite:t}`hu2020dtr`. \n",
    "However, when the horiozn is longer, such an approach quickly becomes computationally infeasible and certain dimension reduction method is then needed. \n",
