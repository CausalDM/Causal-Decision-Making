# Multiple Stages

## Problem Setting
Suppose we have a dataset containning observations from $N$ individuals. For each individual $i$, the observed data is structured as follows
    \begin{align}
    (X_{1i},A_{1i},\cdots,X_{Ti},A_{Ti},Y), i=1,\cdots, N.
    \end{align} 
    Let $h_{ti}=\{X_{1i},A_{1i},\cdots,X_{ti}\})$ includes all the information observed till step t.
